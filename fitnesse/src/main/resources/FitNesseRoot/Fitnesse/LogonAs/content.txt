!2 Description
Logs on as a specific user.  Part of the initialization for a particular story's setup, and typically referenced in the test suite or story's own setup page.  Unlike Naked Objects' own !-LogonFixture-!, the login specified is ''not'' remembered to the end of the setup.  In order to run tests as a particular login it should therefore appear towards the end of the setup.
